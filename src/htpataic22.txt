<h2>22. Client-server</h2>
<p class="intro">
It would be perfectly retro
to have a single person type in every command for every player.
What we made in the previous chapter, might already be enough to run your own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-mail_game">play-by-mail game</a>.
But in the 21st century,
&lsquo;multi-player&rsquo; has become synonymous with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_game">online gaming</a>.
So let&rsquo;s see if we can make that happen!
</p>
<p>
To make our game multi-user, we will turn it into a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>
server.
Each user will connect to the server with a standard
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet">Telnet</a>
client.
Sounds old-school? It is.
But it&rsquo;s probably closest to how the early MUDs were made.
And it&rsquo;s fun to write your own server almost from scratch.
</p>
<p>
So basically,
our program <i>lilcave</i> should be running continuously on a computer.
The computer should always be online; it should never be turned off.
In the early days of the internet,
that typically meant the program would be running on a university
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicomputer">mini</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">mainframe</a>,
under the supervision of the super user
(or more likely, covertly scheduled by a smart student).
</p>
<p>
With today&rsquo;s hardware, any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer">PC</a>
will do fine running such a game.
But since it is an online game, there are a few things to keep in mind.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming your machine has a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)">firewall</a>,
you will need to add a rule allowing <i>inbound</i> traffic to your program,
protocol TCP, port 18811
(or whatever number is being specified in <i>server.c</i>; see below).
With the built-in firewall of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">MS Windows</a>,
that&rsquo;s easy enough: the firewall will automatically
propose the necessary adjustment as soon as you first launch your program.
</li>
<li>Assuming your home network is separated from the internet by a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)">router</a>,
you will need to configure
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding">port forwarding</a>
on the router.
</li>
<li>You may want to keep the game running day and night.
That warrants an energy-efficient machine, for example a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi</a>.
</li>
<li>Rather than running your own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_server">home server</a>,
you might consider having your game
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_hosting_service">hosted</a>
by a third party at a monthly fee.
A
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game">text-based</a>
game typically has small demands, so you could probably settle
for a minimal amount of memory, disk space and bandwidth.
But do make sure the package comes with a C compiler,
as you will need to build your game from source on the hosted server.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Implementing a TCP server in C is pretty straightforward.
It involves writing quite a bit of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code">boilerplate code</a>
around
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets">Berkeley sockets</a>,
the <i>de facto</i> standard for a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model">client-server</a>
application.
Fortunately, code samples can be found anywhere on the internet; even in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(Unix)">the Wikipedia article about select</a>.

<li>Line 13:
I just randomly picked a port number
that was not already in use by any popular online game.
Users need this number, as well as your server&rsquo;s
(external) IP address, to connect to your game.
</li>
<li>Line 15:
function <i>server</i> has a function pointer <i>action</i> as its parameter.
Through this parameter,
we will inject the game engine we have created in the previous chapters.
</li>
<li>Line 19-21:
we start by setting up a listening
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket">socket</a>.
</li>
<li>Line 23-84:
this is the main loop of the game server.
We could stay here forever,
but sooner or later we will be forced to leave by a signal, or by an error.
</li>
<li>Line 25-33:
we build up a collection of clients that are currently connected.
</li>
<li>Line 34:
here, the process waits until some activity is detected from any of the clients.
If an error occurs, we will leave the loop. This will end the game.
</li>
<li>Line 36:
activity on the listening socket means a new client is connecting to the server.
</li>
<li>Line 38-58:
the new client is welcomed.
</li>
<li>Line 60:
looping through all the clients that are currently connected.
</li>
<li>Line 62:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_(system_call)">read</a>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket">socket</a>.
Here we pull in everything typed in by a user.
</li>
<li>Line 68:
in the previous chapter,
we changed <i>player</i> from a fixed object into a variable.
Here, we use this to switch to the correct
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character">player character</a>.
</li>
<li>Line 70:
this is the heart of the server.
It processes the client&rsquo;s input (<i>buffer</i>)
by letting our game engine (parameter <i>action</i>) execute each command,
sending responses back to client sockets.
</li>
<li>Line 71-75:
when a client first connects, they will be nobody (see line 48).
Once the game engine has established who you are,
it will be persisted here.
</li>
<li>Line 77-81:
in this context, no data means the client is disconnecting,
i.e. the user has closed the Telnet client.
</li>
<li>Line 86-90:
when leaving the main loop, close all remaining sockets.
</li>
</ul>

The following module provides access to an array of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">structs</a>
holding information about the clients that have connected to the game.
For each client, there is a file descriptor (the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket">socket</a>),
an object (the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character">player character</a>)
and an input buffer (see <i>telnet.h</i> below).

The following module handles the peculiarities of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet">Telnet</a>
protocol.
It also takes care of buffering client input
(i.e. everything typed in by the users),
and it prevents server output
(which <i>could</i> be pushed at any time by activity from other users)
getting mixed up with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_(computing)">echo</a>
on the same text line in the client&rsquo;s Telnet window.

<ul>
<li>Line 15-22:
Telnet commands that will be sent from server to client
as soon as a connection has been made.
</li>
<li>Line 18:
<i>DO LINEMODE</i>.
Server is telling client that linemode must <i>not</i> be used.
That way, the Telnet client knows it must send every character to the server
the moment the character is typed in,
rather than save up everything until the user presses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_key">enter</a>.
</li>
<li>Line 19:
<i>WILL ECHO</i>.
Server is telling client that server will
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_(computing)">echo</a>
every character sent by client (i.e. typed in by user).
That way, the Telnet client knows it must <i>not</i> do a local echo.
</li>
<li>Line 24-29:
function <i>telnetInsertSpaces</i> outputs a sequence of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character">whitespace</a>
characters to erase the current line of text from the Telnet window.
The first character is always a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return">carriage return</a>,
causing the subsequent spaces to overwrite the current prompt
as well as any characters typed in by the user.
The final character being output is also a carriage return,
so that any subsequent text output by the server will be displayed
on the same line of the Telnet window, starting from the left border.
This is used by <i>print.c</i> (see below)
to re-arrange lines of text on the Telnet window.
Note: I could output Telnet&rsquo;s &lsquo;Erase Line&rsquo; command
instead, but I am not sure this is implemented by every Telnet client.
</li>
<li>Line 31-34:
function <i>telnetDeleteSpaces</i> reverts the effect of
<i>telnetInsertSpaces</i>.
</li>
<li>Line 36-40:
function <i>telnetAppendPrompt</i>
outputs not only the prompt,
but also any characters typed in by the user following the prompt.
This is useful as both may have been wiped from the Telnet window
by function <i>telnetInsertSpaces</i>.
</li>
<li>Line 42-45:
function <i>telnetDeletePrompt</i> reverts the effect of
<i>telnetAppendPrompt</i>.
</li>
<li>Line 47-93:
function <i>telnetParse</i>
processes the user input read from the socket.
</li>
<li>Line 55-63:
Telnet commands in user input are ignored,
but as these commands span multiple characters,
we need some logic to skip them.
The <i>INBUF</i> structure has two fields to keep track of this:
<i>iac</i> is set after reading 0xFF
to indicate the next character must be &lsquo;interpreted as command&rsquo;,
and <i>negotiate</i> is used to detect and skip subnegotiations.
</li>
<li>Line 64-73:
when the user presses enter, we let the game engine (parameter <i>action</i>)
execute a single command (the client&rsquo;s input buffer)
and send responses back to the relevant client sockets.
After that, the input buffer is cleared and a new prompt is sent to the client.
</li>
<li>Line 74-82:
pressing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backspace">backspace</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delete_character">delete</a>
will cause the last character to be removed from the input buffer
and erased from the screen (by overwriting it with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character">whitespace</a>
character).
Note: I could output Telnet&rsquo;s &lsquo;Erase Character&rsquo; command
instead, but I am not sure this is implemented by every Telnet client.
</li>
<li>Line 83-90:
printable ASCII characters are stored in the client&rsquo;s input buffer.
Characters will be discarded if necessary to prevent buffer overflow.
Non-ASCII characters (other than the Telnet commands) are discarded as well;
I have not implemented
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a>
support yet.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
Output produced by the game, should be written to sockets rather than
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_(stdout)">standard output</a>.
This is less straightforward than it seems.
When two or more players are in the same room,
then the actions of one player should be reported to all.
So output may need to go to more than one client.

</li>
<li>Line 12:
the game starts in single-user mode, with all output going to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_(stdout)">stdout</a>.
Once our TCP server is running, this variable will be continuously overwritten
with the file descriptor of the socket owned by the client being serviced.
Our code is single-threaded, so we can get away with using a static variable.
</li>
<li>Line 19-49:
function <i>printDemux</i> acts like a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer">demultiplexer</a>.
Output that has been produced by the game
and buffered by <i>outbuf.c</i> (see below),
is being sent to one or more clients
by repeatedly calling <i>outbufFlush</i>, each time with a different socket.
</li>
<li>Line 40-44:
functions from <i>telnet.c</i> are used
to keep input and output apart on the same Telnet window.
This is not necessary for the client who initiated the output;
that user has just finished entering a command,
and a new input prompt has not been displayed yet,
so it is safe to directly send the output (line 36).
</li>
<li>Line 62-63:
this changes simple sentences from second person to third person perspective.
For example, &ldquo;You go north&rdquo;
will be changed to &ldquo;You see Jack go north.&rdquo;
The former sentence will be sent to the player who entered the command
(&ldquo;go north&rdquo;),
the latter to other players present in the same location.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
The game engine is never sending output
directly to any sockets or other file handles.
Instead, everything is sent to an output buffer.
This makes it possible to manipulate the text
before sending it off to the various sockets,
as seen in <i>telnet.c</i> and <i>print.c</i> (above).

function <i>asSpace</i> translates a character to a

Most ASCII characters can be overwritten with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)">space</a>,
but a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_key#Tab_characters">tab</a>
should be overwritten with another tab, to match its size on screen.
</li>
<li>Line 98:
this is where the contents of the output buffer
are actually sent off to a socket or to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_(stdout)">stdout</a>.

</li>
<li>Line 21-24:
the program must regularly call function <i>breakTest</i>.
As long as the function returns <i>true</i>, it is safe to continue.
As soon as the function returns <i>false</i>,
the program should finish its current activity and exit as soon as possible.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So we now have a new multi-user game loop (the TCP server),
but that does not mean we will discard the original single-user game loop.
We still need this loop to resume a saved game, as discussed in chapter 16.
After the log file of an earlier game session has been processed,
it is even possible to enter additional commands manually,
but in most cases, you will want to exit this loop right away
by entering &lsquo;quit&rsquo; or pressing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file">EOF</a>.
The program will then continue to start up its TCP server.

<li>Line 60-82:
function <i>processInputAndLog</i>
is a wrapper around <i>processInput</i>
that logs every command of every player while in multi-user mode.
In single-user mode,
it is more convenient to do the logging in function <i>getInput</i>,
as we need to make the switch there
between reading from and writing to the log (line 48-49).
</li>
<li>Line 90:
the initial single-user game loop.
</li>
<li>Line 93:
this is the multi-user game loop.
It will continue running until the program receives a signal

By today&rsquo;s standards,
our program can hardly be called a mature game server.
It has several flaws:
</p>
<ul>
<li>No
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication">authentication</a>.
This could be fixed by demanding a password to be included
in command <i>play</i>.
</li>
<li>Vulnerable to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_eavesdropping">eavesdropping</a>:
everything is transmitted unencrypted, including passwords!
This could be fixed with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcpcrypt">tcpcrypt</a>
or with a secure tunnel (through
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol#SSH">SSH</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a>).
</li>
<li>Vulnerable to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>.
Again, a user&rsquo;s password could be intercepted.
To mitigate that, you&rsquo;d need a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate">digital certificate</a>.
</li>
<li>Does not
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability">scale</a>
well. First of all,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(Unix)">select</a>
suffers from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">C10k problem</a>
and should be replaced by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_(Unix)">poll</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll">epoll</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue">kqueue</a>.
Secondly, it is not straightforward to scale out to multiple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)">nodes</a>.
A solution might be to partition the game into multiple &lsquo;worlds.&rsquo;
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It would make more sense to turn the whole game into a web application.
For that, it&rsquo;s probably best to port the program to
a different programming language, for example JavaScript.
We will give that a shot in chapter 25.

<h1>How to program a text adventure in C</h1>
<h2>7. Distance</h2>
<p class="intro">
A typical adventure contains many puzzles.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom">Infocom</a>
adventures were notoriously difficult to complete; solving every puzzle
might require weeks, even months of trial and error.
Don&rsquo;t be surprised if the majority of replies from the game
are &lsquo;errors&rsquo;:
you can&rsquo;t do this; you can&rsquo;t go there; you died.
I hate adventures that just return &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t&rdquo;
in response to every attempt I make to solve one of the game&rsquo;s puzzles.
Such a reply is dull and not very helpful.
It neglects an important aspect of any computer game;
in fact, an essential part of life itself:
the player has to learn from his mistakes.
It is OK for an adventure to be difficult, even frustratingly difficult.
But when the player has the feeling he is not making any progress at all,
or when the only way to make progress is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force">brute-force</a>
attack on all verb-noun combinations,
then even the most hardened player will lose interest and eventually give up.
The least an adventure game should do,
is explain <i>why</i> the player&rsquo;s command cannot be completed:
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that, because...&rdquo;
This helps to make the virtual world more convincing,
the story more credible, and the game more enjoyable.
</p>
<p>
I already put quite some effort in
having the game <b>explain why</b> certain commands are ineffective.
Just take a look at the many <i>printf</i> calls in
<i>noun.c</i>, <i>inventory.c</i>, <i>location.c</i>, <i>move.c</i>.
But as the game is getting increasingly complex,
this is becoming quite a burden.
I need a more structural way to detect and handle error conditions.
That is what we will be working on in this chapter.
</p>
<p>
Most commands operate on one or more <b>objects</b>, for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The player picks up an <b>item</b>, then gives it to another <b>actor</b>.
</li>
<li>The player follows a <b>passage</b> to another <b>location</b>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first thing to check (after the obvious
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_error">typos</a>
caught by the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parser</a>)
is for the <b>presence</b> of these objects;
failure should result in something like
&ldquo;There is no ... here&rdquo; or
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see any ...&rdquo;
In this chapter, we will build a generic function that can be used
by every command to find out if an object is within reach of the player.
</p>
<p>
You may think we only need to distinguish two cases:
either the object is here, or it is not.
But many commands require more gradients than just
&lsquo;here&rsquo; and &lsquo;not here&rsquo;.
Examples:
<ul>
<li>To <b>use</b> a weapon or a tool, the player must be holding it;
its mere presence at the scene is not enough.
</li>
<li>To <b>drop</b> an item, you must be holding it;
to <b>pick up</b> an item, you must <i>not</i> be holding it.
</li>
<li>Another actor holding an item, may keep the player from getting that item;
<b>get item</b> is typically easier when the item is just lying here.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It all boils down to the fact that
there are different notions of &lsquo;here&rsquo;:
</p>
<table cellpadding="8"><tr>
<td class="snippet">distSelf</td>
<td class="comment">The object is the player</td>
<td class="snippet"><span class="red">object</span> == <span class="red">player</span></td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="snippet">distHeld</td>
<td class="comment">The player is holding the object</td>
<td class="snippet"><span class="red">object</span>-&gt;location == <span class="red">player</span></td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="snippet">distHeldContained</td>
<td class="comment">The player is holding another object (for example a bag)
containing the object</td>
<td class="snippet"><span class="red">object</span>-&gt;location != NULL &amp;&amp;
<span class="red">object</span>-&gt;location-&gt;location == <span class="red">player</span></td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="snippet">distLocation</td>
<td class="comment">The object is the player&rsquo;s location</td>
<td class="snippet"><span class="red">object</span> == <span class="red">player</span>-&gt;location</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="snippet">distHere</td>
<td class="comment">The object is present at the player&rsquo;s location</td>
<td class="snippet"><span class="red">object</span>-&gt;location == <span class="red">player</span>-&gt;location</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="snippet">distHereContained</td>
<td class="comment">Another object
(either an actor or a &lsquo;container&rsquo;),
present at the player&rsquo;s location,
is holding (but <i>not</i> hiding) the object</td>
<td class="snippet"><span class="red">object</span>-&gt;location != NULL &amp;&amp;
<span class="red">object</span>-&gt;location-&gt;location == <span class="red">player</span>-&gt;location</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="snippet">distOverthere</td>
<td class="comment">The object is a nearby location</td>
<td class="snippet">getPassage(<span class="red">player</span>-&gt;location, <span class="red">object</span>) != NULL</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
The first case (object is player) may seem trivial,
but it is important nonetheless.
For example, the command "examine yourself" should <i>not</i> return
"There is no yourself here."
</p>
<p>
I tried to follow a logical order:
nearby things are at the top, further down below they become more distant.
We can continue the list, to cover objects that are even further away:
</p>
<table cellpadding="8"><tr>
<td class="snippet">distNotHere</td>
<td class="comment">The object is (or appears to be) not here</td>
<td class="snippet">&nbsp;</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="snippet">distUnknownObject</td>
<td class="comment">The parser did not recognize the noun entered</td>
<td class="snippet"><span class="red">object</span> == NULL</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Notice we have seven different cases of &lsquo;here&rsquo;,
but only one for &lsquo;not here&rsquo;.
This is because typically, the game only needs to provide information
about things that can be perceived by the player.
If it&rsquo;s not here, then there&rsquo;s nothing more to say.
</p>
<p>
In the leftmost column, I proposed a symbolic name for each case.
We will gather these names in an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type">enum</a>
named <b>DISTANCE</b>.
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">typedef enum {
   distSelf,
   distHeld,
   distHeldContained,
   distLocation,
   distHere,
   distHereContained,
   distOverthere,
   distNotHere,
   distUnknownObject
} DISTANCE;
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
And in the rightmost column, I proposed a condition for each case to satisfy.
With a little reshuffling, we can easily turn this into a function
that calculates the &lsquo;distance&rsquo; of an object
(as seen from the player&rsquo;s point of view):
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">DISTANCE getDistance(OBJECT *from, OBJECT *to)
{
   return to == NULL                               ? distUnknownObject :
          to == from                               ? distSelf :
          to-&gt;location == from                     ? distHeld :
          to == from-&gt;location                     ? distLocation :
          to-&gt;location == from-&gt;location           ? distHere :
          getPassage(from-&gt;location, to) != NULL   ? distOverthere :
          to-&gt;location == NULL                     ? distNotHere :
          to-&gt;location-&gt;location == from           ? distHeldContained :
          to-&gt;location-&gt;location == from-&gt;location ? distHereContained :
                                                     distNotHere;
}
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
That&rsquo;s all!
We can call this function and do a comparison on its return value.
For example, we had the following piece of code in <i>noun.c</i>:
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">else if (!(obj == player ||
           obj == player-&gt;location ||
           obj-&gt;location == player ||
           obj-&gt;location == player-&gt;location ||
           getPassage(player-&gt;location, obj) != NULL ||
           (obj-&gt;location != NULL &amp;&amp;
            (obj-&gt;location-&gt;location == player ||
             obj-&gt;location-&gt;location == player-&gt;location))))
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
We can now replace each sub-condition by an appropriate distance check:
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">else if (!(getDistance(player, obj) == distSelf ||
           getDistance(player, obj) == distLocation ||
           getDistance(player, obj) == distHeld ||
           getDistance(player, obj) == distHere ||
           getDistance(player, obj) == distOverthere ||
           getDistance(player, obj) == distHeldContained ||
           getDistance(player, obj) == distHereContained)
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
This can be reduced to:
</p>
<table><tr>
<td class="snippet">else if (getDistance(player, obj) >= distNotHere)
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
This was just an example to give you an idea of the concept;
the actual implementation of <i>noun.c</i> you will find below,
looks slightly different.
</p>
<p>
Time to put things into place.
The definitions of enum <i>DISTANCE</i> and function <i>getDistance</i>
are added to <i>misc.h</i> and <i>misc.c</i>,
since we will be using them in more than one module.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>misc.h</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff misc.h
</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>misc.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff misc.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<div class="explanation">
<p>
Explanation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 6-9:
a little helper function <i>isHolding</i>
which we will be using in various places.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
In function <i>executeGo</i>,
we can replace most of the <i>if</i> conditions by a check on distance.
</p>
<table class="demo">
<tr><th>Sample output</th></tr>
<tr><td>
#test
</td></tr>
</table>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>location.h</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff location.h
</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>location.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#ldiff location.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
The same goes for function <i>executeGet</i>.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>inventory.h</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff inventory.h
</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>inventory.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff inventory.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
And finally, we will adjust the constraints in <i>noun.c</i>.
I am adding two parameters to function <i>getObject</i>
that make it possible to find a match for a specific noun,
while at the same time ignore any objects that are considered absent.
This will really pay off in the next chapter,
where we will introduce different objects having the same tag.
</p>
<table class="code"><tr>
<th>noun.h</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff noun.h
</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>noun.c</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>
#diff noun.c
</td>
</tr></table>
<div class="explanation">
<p>
Explanation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 17:
only consider objects with a distance from object &lsquo;from&rsquo;
that is less than or equal to <i>maxDistance</i>;
any objects farther away are ignored.
Because of the way enum <i>DISTANCE</i> is numbered
(increasing values for increasing distance),
the &lsquo;less than&rsquo; operator (<tt>&lt;</tt>)
automatically means &lsquo;nearer than&rsquo;.
</li>
<li>Line 27:
<i>getObject</i> is called with distance <i>distOverthere</i>,
meaning everything outside the player&rsquo;s visible range is ignored.
</li>
<li>Line 49:
<i>getObject</i> is called with distance <i>distHeldContained</i>,
which limits the scope to any objects held by the player
(and the player himself).
</li>
<li>Lines 30 and 51:
if the first call to <i>getObject</i> yields nothing,
then we always make a second call with a bigger distance,
to decide between a noun that was ignored (based on its distance),
and a noun that just could not be found to match <i>any</i> object.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
The other modules
(<i><i>main.c</i>, parsexec.c</i>, <i>move.c</i>, <i>object.c</i>)
remain unchanged, you can see them in previous chapters.
</p>
<p>
In this chapter, the concept of <i>distance</i> was mainly used
to choose between different responses the game can give to the user.
But the benefits of distance are not reserved to the <b>output</b> side;
it can be used equally well to make improvements on the <b>input</b> side.
In the next chapter,
we will use distance to improve the recognition of nouns entered by the user.

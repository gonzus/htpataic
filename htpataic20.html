<h1>How to program a text adventure in C</h1>
<h2>20. Combat</h2>
<p class="intro">
Since the early classics were influenced by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy">fantasy</a>,
it is not surprising that many text-based games adopted elements from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game">RPG games</a>
like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>.
</p>
<p>
Multi-player games thrive on role play and combat; you see that in every
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a>.
Single-player games on the other hand, typically focus on puzzle solving.
The boundary lines are not always that sharp, so in the absence of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">the internet</a>
as we know it today,
there were plenty of single-player games that featured combat,
though often in a simplified form.
</p>
<p>
When implementing combat in a text adventure,
you will have to choose between real-time and turn-based.
In multi-player games, turn-based only makes sense when playing offline (as in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-mail_game">play-by-mail</a>).
Online players do not want to be kept waiting for other players to respond,
which is why a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a>
is always played in real time.
This brings a few coding challenges; in particular
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_(computer_science)">synchronization</a>.
It's also important to implement some kind of cool-down,
to prevent things like combat to turn into a speed typing contest.
</p>
<p>
Single-player games are typically turn-based.
Computers respond faster than humans,
so a human player will not be frustrated by the time it takes
for a non-player character to respond to the player's actions.
Turn-based has the advantage of not rushing players,
giving them all the time in the world to think about their next move,
while at the same time offering instant feedback
at every attempt from the player to solve that seemingly unsolvable problem.
</p>
<p>
Turn-based does not mean there is no notion of time;
it's just not <i>real time</i>.
Every command from the user is a 'turn' in the game.
During that turn, some 'game time' passes,
which gives other (non-player) characters an equal opportunity to take action.
For example, after the player has taken a swing at an orc,
it's the orc turn to retaliate.
</p>
<p>
Please note that this return action is not necessarily implied by the player's command.
Once enraged, the orc is likely to keep responding with violence,
regardless of what the player's subsequent commands will be.
Therefore, it is best to implement all actions from 'the rest of the world'
not as part of any user command, but as a separate step in the main loop.
(Remember the main loop from chapter 2?)
</p>
<p>
In it's simplest form, every command represents an equal time slice.
But it's also possible to make certain commands 'consume' more time than others,
giving the rest of the world more time to do their 'thing' in response.
For example, the player may be given the opportunity
to travel from one town to another with a single 'go' command,
but that may cost the player so much game time,
that night will fall halfway through,
bringing out nasty night crawlers.
At the very least, I would recommend to let 'supportive' commands,
for example 'help', 'save', 'load', consume zero game time.
These commands are not part of the storyline;
it would be unfair to penalize the player for using them.
